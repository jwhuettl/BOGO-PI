notes for bogo pi

  iteration count
    
    move to approximate count 
      1. saves on memory
      2. avoid some integer funkery

    how it might work
      1. bench mark 1 second with count (this is our approximate iterations per second)
      2. take marker at start
      3. (do the stuff)
      4. marker at end 
      5. math time (multiple seconds by count)
