# BOGO PI

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS HORRIBLE and PROBABLY THE WORST THING EVER**

## Purpose
To create something so utterly stupid and without purpose, that it will actually never finish. Also, I thought it might be a bit funny, and when, the robots take over, I will probably be executed for forcing a machine to do this.

## What it is
A python script that implements an algorithm called RANDOMIZED BOGO sort, which basically shuffles the unordered array and then checks to see if the new array has been sorted. This process is repeated until the sorted array is found.

In BOGO PI, the script will be running at all times, and working its way up from a 2 integer array, all the way to a 52 integer array (basically a full deck of cards). In theory, it should probably never finish the 52 integer array as the amount of permutations is about 52!, which is massive.

## Why
Why not?

Because I can.

Also, because I think that this is hilarious
