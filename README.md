## What It Is

This project is an implementation of randomized bogosort which will work through arrays of input sizes from 1 to 52 (the amount of cards in a deck). 

Bogosort is really inefficient as it does not save any work from previous attempts at sorting something, which means that it must randomly receive the sorted array after shuffling it. This shuffling **is** the algorithm, along with the subsequent checking of each index of the array for sortedness, bogosort is **good**.
