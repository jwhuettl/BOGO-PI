# BOGO PI

**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS HORRIBLE and PROBABLY THE WORST THING EVER**

#### Purpose
To create something so utterly stupid and without purpose, that it will actually never finish. Also, I thought it might be a bit funny, and when, the robots take over, I will probably be executed for forcing a machine to do this.
<br />
However, I do think this could be an interesting to do an in-depth look at and I have not seen anyone else do something this dumb. Also it is a great example of putting algorithmic analysis in practice.

#### How it works
This program implements the randomized bogosort algorithm and works its way up from an input size of 1 to 52. The randomized bogosort algorithm works by randomly shuffling all elements and checking for sortedness, this process is repeated until the input has been sorted.

#### How to use it
Currently, all twitter bot commands have been commented out, so as to not throw errors about missing configurations. There are notes within the code about how to enable that feature.
<br />
To use enter this command: <br />
`python3 bogo.py` <br />
or <br />
`python3 bogo.py r` <-- to resume <br />

#### Dependencies
1. Python 3 (written in this language)
2. Tweepy (for twitterbot functions)
3. time (it will take awhile)

#### Files
1. bogo.py : actual bogosort
2. bogo-bot.py : twitterbot code
3. bogo-rec.py : nonworking recursive bogosort
3. /logs : logs folder
4. /docs : contains extended documentation
